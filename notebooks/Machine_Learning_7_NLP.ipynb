The idea is pretty simple : we want to automatically predict whether a text expresses positive or negative sentiments. To do so we will use the IMDB dataset, that contains 50000 movie reviews from the www.imdb.com website, and their corresponding sentiment : positive or negative. It is thus a binary classification problem, where we want to predict a binary target $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$. We will go through different ways of encoding a text in a vectorial form $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, as well as different classification models, from classic ways to modern deep learning models."

    "Now we have cleaned the reviews of our dataset, how do we represent them as vectors in order to classify it ? \n",
    "One classic way to achieve that is the Bag-Of-Words (BOW) approach. To encode a text in a bag of word, we first need to know all the different words $w$ that appear in all our reviews, called the vocabulary : $w \\in \\mathcal{V}$. For each word $w$ we attribute an index $idx(w) = i$ with $i \\in \\{0, |\\mathcal{V}|-1\\}$, and represent a review $r$ as a vector of the size of the vocabulary $x_r \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{V}|}$. To encode a review we are simply going to count how many time each word appears and assign it at its corresponding index in the bag-of-words vector : $x_{r,i} = count(w,r)$, where i = idx(w). \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we completely disregard the words order, and simply take into account the number of times each word appears in each review to represent them. There are many variations of this concept, TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) for example, gives more weight to uncommon words. Read more about BOW and TF-IDF there:\n",

Here we will only consider the 25000 most frequent words of the training set, meaning the words that are only in the test set will be ignored. Thus we have : $x_r \\in \\mathbb{R^{25000}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encode all the reviews as bag-of-words, and train and evaluate a logistic regression model on the following train test splits. As we have seen previously, if we wanted to investigate this model we should also grid search for hyperparameters by doing a cross-validation with validation sets, etc. However this is not the goal today, so we'll simply go for a train/test split for this experiment. Concerning the evaluation metrics, in this case we care equally about correctly predicting the positives and the negatives, and we have a balanced dataset, thus we can simply use accuracy this time.\n",
